# A new start 

Hello everyone. If you guys are reading this, thank you very much.
My name is Khánh (you can call me Kris as well), a Computer Science student at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology - Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City. My hometown is Saigon, Vietnam, and I love this city so much :D. I am also a ambitious person, but I think I need to be more discipline in order to achieve success. Therefore, I created this blog to share what I've learned down the road.

# About this blog 
This blog started at 16 March, 2024. This is a place for me to write about my projects, my study diary, as well as non-technical posts as well. My interests are Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and how to apply them into our day-to-day live. Besides that, I am also interest in Music and Photography. 

Thank you again if you are reading this. :D.
